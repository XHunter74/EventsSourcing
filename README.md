# EventSourcing Test Project

This is a test project demonstrating an Event Sourcing architecture for a simple bank account domain, implemented in ASP.NET Core with C# and Entity Framework Core (PostgreSQL).

## Overview

The project exposes a REST API for managing bank accounts, supporting operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and projection saving. All state changes are persisted as events, and the current state is reconstructed by replaying these events.

## Key Patterns and Concepts

- **Event Sourcing**: All changes to application state are stored as a sequence of events. The current state of an entity (e.g., Account) is rebuilt by replaying these events.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: The project separates commands (state-changing operations) from queries (read operations), using the `CQRSMediatr` library for mediation.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The codebase uses aggregates (e.g., `AccountAggregate`), value objects, and domain events to model business logic.
- **Repository Pattern**: Entity Framework Core is used as the data access layer, abstracting persistence concerns.
- **Mediator Pattern**: The `CQRSMediatr` library is used to decouple request handling from controllers.
- **Exception Handling Middleware**: Custom middleware is used for consistent API error responses.
- **Automapper Pattern**: Mapper classes (e.g., `AccountMapper`, `EventsMapper`) are used to convert between domain models and DTOs.

## Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core (.NET 8)
- Entity Framework Core (PostgreSQL)
- Serilog (logging)
- Swashbuckle (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- CQRSMediatr (CQRS and Mediator implementation)
- **Aspire (.NET Aspire)** (cloud-native development, environment orchestration)

## Project Structure

- `Aggregates/` - Domain aggregates and root logic
- `Controllers/` - API controllers
- `Data/` - Entity models, DbContext, and migrations
- `Events/` - Domain events
- `Exceptions/` - Custom exception types
- `Extensions/` - Extension methods (e.g., for exception handling, DB migration)
- `Features/` - Command and query handlers (CQRS)
- `Mappers/` - Mapping between domain models and DTOs
- `Models/` - DTOs


## Building and Running the Project with Aspire

This project uses **.NET Aspire** to orchestrate the development environment, including infrastructure dependencies like PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ. Aspire simplifies local development and deployment by managing service lifecycles and configuration.

### Steps:

1. Ensure you have the [.NET Aspire workload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/install) installed.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or VS Code.
3. Start the Aspire AppHost project (`EventSourcing.Aspire.AppHost`). This will automatically provision and start all required services (including PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ) and the main application.
4. Swagger UI will be available at `/swagger` once the application is running.

You no longer need to manually start PostgreSQL or RabbitMQâ€”Aspire handles this for you.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/account` - Create a new account
- `GET /api/account/{id}` - Get account by ID (optionally by version)
- `PUT /api/account/{id}/deposit` - Deposit money
- `PUT /api/account/{id}/withdraw` - Withdraw money
- `POST /api/account/{id}/save` - Save account projection
